# Organizing the Development Timeline

## Timeline Planning

Now that we have our issues, milestones, and board set up, let's organize our development timeline effectively.

### Setting Up Due Dates

1. Navigate to **Plan** > **Issues**
2. For each MVP issue, let's set realistic due dates:

   **Core Task Management (Weight: 8)**
   - Due date: MVP start + 1 week
   - Rationale: Highest weight, core functionality needs to be done first
   
   **Task List Interface (Weight: 5)**
   - Due date: MVP start + 1.5 weeks
   - Rationale: Depends on core functionality, but can start some UI work in parallel
   
   **Basic Documentation (Weight: 3)**
   - Due date: MVP start + 2 weeks
   - Rationale: Needs to reflect final functionality, but can be worked on incrementally

### Setting Up a Timeline View

1. In your milestone, you can now see:
   - Total number of issues
   - Completed vs remaining issues
   - Weight completion percentage
   - Days remaining

2. Use the milestone view to:
   - Track overall progress
   - Identify potential delays early
   - Ensure even distribution of work
   - Monitor issue completion rate

### Best Practices for Timeline Management

1. **Regular Updates**
   - Move issues across the board as work progresses
   - Update issue weights if complexity changes
   - Add comments for blockers or delays

2. **Timeline Monitoring**
   - Check burndown chart weekly
   - Adjust due dates if needed
   - Keep milestone descriptions updated

3. **Work Distribution**
   - Consider issue weights when planning work
   - Avoid clustering high-weight issues at the end
   - Leave buffer for unexpected challenges

> **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip**: While we've set specific dates, stay flexible. If you notice the burndown chart showing you're behind, consider:
> - Breaking down large issues into smaller ones
> - Adjusting scope while keeping core functionality
> - Re-evaluating issue weights based on new information

# Part 4: Project Monitoring and Tracking

## Step 8: Setting Up Monitoring Systems

### Configure Issue Activity Monitoring

1. Go to your project's **Plan** > **Issues**
2. Set up issue activity tracking:
   - Enable notification settings for:
     - Issue status changes
     - Due date updates
     - Label changes

### Create Project Overview Page

1. Go to your project Wiki
2. Create a new page titled "Project Status Dashboard"
3. Add the following sections:

```markdown
# Project Status Dashboard

## Quick Links
- [Issue Board](../boards)
- [Milestone Progress](../milestones)
- [Project Issues](../issues)

## Current Status
- MVP Progress: x% complete
- Current Sprint: MVP Development
- Active Issues: x
- Completed Issues: x

## Recent Updates
(Add weekly status updates here)

## Risk Register
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Technical debt accumulation | Medium | Regular code reviews |
| Timeline slippage | High | Weekly progress checks |
| Feature scope creep | Medium | Strict MVP definition |

## Next Milestones
- MVP Release: [Due Date]
- Enhanced Features: [Due Date]
```

### Set Up Progress Tracking

1. Create a tracking issue:
   - Title: "Weekly Progress Tracking"
   - Description:
```markdown
This issue tracks weekly progress for TaskMaster development.

## Week 1
- [ ] Core Task Management started
- [ ] Initial UI wireframes
- [ ] Basic documentation structure

## Week 2
- [ ] Core Task Management completed
- [ ] Task List Interface implementation
- [ ] Documentation draft

## Success Metrics
- All MVP issues closed
- Documentation completed
- No critical bugs
```

### Configure Important Views

1. **Customize Issue Board View**
   - Add milestone filter
   - Show issue weights
   - Display labels clearly

2. **Set Up Personal Dashboard**
   - Star the project for quick access
   - Pin important issues
   - Configure notification preferences

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip**: Create saved views of your issue board for different purposes:
> - "Daily Standup View" (filtered by current milestone)
> - "High Priority View" (filtered by priority::high)
> - "My Tasks View" (filtered by your assignments)

### Regular Monitoring Tasks

**Daily:**
- Check issue board for blockers
- Update issue status
- Review new comments/mentions

**Weekly:**
- Update progress tracking issue
- Review burndown chart
- Update project status dashboard
- Adjust timeline if needed

**Milestone End:**
- Review all completed issues
- Document lessons learned
- Plan next milestone
- Update documentation

> **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip**: Remember that monitoring isn't just about tracking - it's about acting on the information you gather. Use these tools to make informed decisions about project direction and resource allocation.

Let me know once you've set up these monitoring systems, and we'll wrap up with some best practices for maintaining project organization over time.
