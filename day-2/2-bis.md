# Building a Pet Accessories E-commerce Platform with GitLab

In this tutorial, we'll build a pet accessories e-commerce platform called "PawStyle" using GitLab's comprehensive project management and development tools.   
We'll follow GitLab's recommended workflow and best practices for planning, organizing, and executing the project.

## Step 1: Project Structure Planning

Before diving into code, let's start by planning our project structure and setting up our GitLab workspace properly.

### 1.1 Project Overview
our PawStyle platform will need:
- A web application (for desktop browsers)
- An iOS mobile app
- An Android mobile app
- Shared documentation

### 1.2 Creating the Group Structure
We'll start by creating a top-level group and organizing our projects:

1. First, create a top-level group called "PawStyle"
   - Navigate to GitLab and select "Create new" -> "New group"
   - Set visibility level (recommend starting with "Private" for commercial projects)
   - Enter group details:
     - Group name: PawStyle
     - Group URL: pawstyle
     - Description: Pet accessories e-commerce platform

2. Create a subgroup for mobile development:
   - Within PawStyle group, create a new subgroup called "Mobile"
   - This will contain both iOS and Android projects

3. Final group structure should look like this:
   ```bash
   PawStyle (Top-level group)
   ├── Mobile (Subgroup)
   │   ├── iOS (Project)
   │   └── Android (Project)
   ├── Web (Project)
   └── Documentation (Project)
   ```
The group structure follows GitLab's recommended organization pattern, allowing us to:

- Manage permissions at the group level
- Share resources between related projects
- Keep mobile development organized separately
- Maintain documentation in a centralized location
