# GitLab Project Planning Tutorial: Building TaskMaster

Welcome to this hands-on tutorial where you'll learn GitLab's project planning and organization features by building TaskMaster, a personal task management web application. This tutorial focuses on proper project setup and planning using GitLab's powerful tools.

## Prerequisites
- A GitLab.com account
- Basic understanding of web applications
- A web browser
- About 4-6 hours of time

## Tutorial Overview
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
1. Set up project structure in GitLab
2. Use GitLab's planning tools to organize work
3. Break down features into manageable tasks
4. Track progress effectively
5. Collaborate using GitLab's features

## Part 1: Initial Setup & Project Structure

### Step 1: Create a Group
First, we'll create a group to organize our project:

1. Log into GitLab.com
2. Click the "+" button at the top of the left sidebar
3. Select "New group"
4. For the group setup:
   - Name: `taskmaster-app`
   - Visibility level: Public
   - Group URL: Will auto-populate based on the name
5. Click "Create group"

A group provides a dedicated space for our TaskMaster application and potential future related projects. You can think of it as a container that can hold multiple related projects, making it easier to manage access control and organize work at a higher level.

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip**: While you could create the project directly without a group, using a group structure provides better organization and scalability. It allows you to add more related projects later and manage permissions at a group level.

Let me know once you've created your group and we'll move on to creating our project within it.
