# Moving from Planning to Implementation in GitLab

## Overview
In this section, we'll move from the planning phase to actual implementation by creating our first feature branch and setting up our project structure.

## Technical Stack and Project Structure

### Defining Our Tech Stack
For TaskMaster, we'll use:

Component | Technology | Purpose
----------|------------|----------
Frontend | React.js + Tailwind CSS | Modern, responsive UI
Backend | Node.js + Express | Lightweight server
Database | MongoDB | Flexible document storage
Testing | Jest | Unit testing framework

### Project Structure sample
```
/frontend
  /src
    /components      # Reusable UI components
    /pages          # Page-level components
    /services       # API communication
/backend
  /src
    /controllers    # Request handlers
    /models        # Data models
    /routes        # API routes
    /services      # Business logic
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

1. Navigate to your project's repository:
   - Click **Code > Branches** in the left sidebar

2. Create a new branch:
   - Click the **New branch** button
   - Name: `1-core-task-management` (prefixed with issue number)
   - Source: `main` branch
   - Click **Create branch**

### 2. Create a Merge Request (MR)

1. Navigate to merge requests:
   - Click **Merge Requests > New merge request**

2. Select branches:
   - Source branch: `1-core-task-management`
   - Target branch: `main`
   - Click "Compare branches and continue"

3. Fill in merge request details:
   ```
   Title: Implement core task management
   
   Description:
   Implements core task management functionality as defined in #1

   ## Technical Stack
   - Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS
   - Backend: Node.js with Express
   - Database: MongoDB
   - Testing: Jest

   ## Project Structure
   [Insert project structure from above]

   ## Implementation Scope
   - Basic project scaffolding
   - Core task model
   - CRUD operations for tasks
   - Basic UI components

   Closes #1
   ```

4. Set options:
   - Check "Delete source branch when merge request is accepted"
   - Click "Create merge request"

## Best Practices

1. 📌 **Branch Naming**
   - Always prefix with issue number: `issue_number-brief-description`
   - Use hyphens for spaces
   - Keep names short but descriptive

2. 🔄 **Early MR Creation**
   - Create MR as soon as you create the branch
   - Use draft status if not ready for review
   - Enables early feedback and discussion

3. 🔗 **Issue Linking**
   - Reference issues in commit messages and MR description
   - Use closing keywords (Closes #X) when appropriate

## What's Next?
- Add initial project scaffolding
- Implement basic CRUD operations
- Create fundamental UI components
- Request early feedback from team members

## Common Issues and Solutions

Problem | Solution
--------|----------
Branch creation fails | Ensure you have proper permissions and your repository isn't locked
Can't see new branch | Try refreshing the page or checking your branch filter
MR creation fails | Verify source and target branches exist and you have proper access rights

## Pro Tips
- 💡 Create MRs early to facilitate discussion
- 🔍 Keep initial commits focused and well-documented
- 📝 Use clear commit messages referencing the issue
- 👥 Request early feedback on technical approach
